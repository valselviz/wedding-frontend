# Frontend - Wedding Management System

Web interface for managing guests, groups, and tables for a wedding. Built with Next.js 16 and React.

## What does this project do?

Web application that allows you to:
- **Manage guests**: create, edit, search, and filter guests. Confirm or decline attendance in bulk.
- **Organize groups**: create groups of guests (family, friends, etc.) and assign members.
- **Assign tables**: (future functionality) distribute guests to tables automatically or manually.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Backend must be running on `http://localhost:3000` (or configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`)

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure API (optional)

If the backend runs on a different port or URL, create a `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Defaults to `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Start development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` - Development server (port 3001)
- `npm run build` - Build app for production
- `npm run start` - Run compiled version
- `npm run lint` - Run linter
